I've always been interested in maps. One year when I was about seven, my grandpa gave 
me a globe and an atlas for my birthday and they were some of my favorite gifts ever. 
When I was older and started my PhD, I got into geostatistics and through some other 
work I had the opportunity to start playing around with other geospatial data. 

Recently, I needed to make a map showing locations of some key points from a project 
I had been working on in Fiji with the organization Engineers Without Borders. So I 
started making interactive maps using a software called Leaflet, which has a 
convenient interface through R. Below are two maps--the first one was a simple trial 
I did, and the second one shows information from the EWB project in Fiji I was working 
on. The locations for the second map were taken either from a handheld gps device or 
geotagged photos from my phone.
