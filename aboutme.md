Hello! My name is Bradley Harken and this is my website. I'm a nerd with many 
interests, most of which involve math or science to some degree. I also really 
like water. So much that I actually spent a decade studying it. Specifically, in 
udergrad at the University of Pittsburgh I double majored in civil engineering 
(with a focus on water resources engineering) and environmental studies. After 
that, I went to UC Berkeley where I did my MS and PhD in environmental engineering. 
While I was a PhD student I got hooked on programming, and ever since then I try to 
solve every problem using R, Python, or Matlab/Octave (or SQL when it's necessary). 
So far I've managed to use these languages to solve common computational problems, such as 
statistical analysis, probabilistic modeling, and various numerical tasks, but 
I've also found other ways to have fun with programming, such as creating my own 
image filters. I enjoy working on new and diverse projects, because they usually 
offer me the chance to learn something new (such as creating a website for fun). 

Through my work experience, research experience, classes I've taken, and classes I've 
taught (either as a Graduate Student Instructor or a Lecturer), I have been able to 
learn a wide variety of subjects in mathematics, statistics, and sciences along with 
some interesting ways to use scientific programming to solve such problems. Something 
that I find particularly interesting is a holistic view of data--not just how we can 
use data to build models and make predictions, but how we can use data to make 
*decisions*. This is often a process that involves analyzing data with descriptive 
statistics, then fitting some sort of predictive model, then making a decision based 
on the predictive model output, along with the level of uncertainty in such predictions. 
This was a major theme of my disseration research and something that I still spend a lot 
of time thinking about. 

I spend a lot of my free time volunteering with the San Francisco chapter of 
Engineers Without Borders, which gives me the opportunity to work on cool projects 
with some cool people, both locally and internationally. The past two years I've 
traveled to Fiji to work on some water infrastructure projects in some rural villages.
